# Ascii-Music-Player
A python program that played music while displaying an ASCII image of the respective album art.

I wrote this in high school, and attempted to revise it and actually comment code about a year after graduating from high school. Please excuse the abysmal coding and comments.

I own NONE of the art, music, or other properties used in this program

# Issues
I realize now that its a bad place to host the actual files on the site, as it's almost 2 GB of music on its lonesome.
